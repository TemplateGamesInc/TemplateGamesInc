- 👋 Hi, I’m @TemplateGamesInc, im a young developer that wants to make games to entertain. i started to do this because of my experience in games so i wondered if i could do it too.
- 👀 I’m interested in creating and playing gaming websites. i started playing these games on a phone and worked my way up to computer.
